Thats it now every time you change a file you will get live reload.

this is the structure of the project:
* src contains all the source files
* every component sould end with .component.js
* utils.js contains functions that are general and used at more than one place
* docs contains the builded version (it was named build but changed it to docs to get a better link for github pages)
